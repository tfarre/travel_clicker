# Game Formulas Configuration
# All monetary values are stored in CENTIMES (1€ = 100 centimes)
# This ensures integer arithmetic and avoids floating-point precision issues

formulas:
    # Building cost scaling: cost = baseCost × (costGrowthRate ^ owned)
    # At 1.15, each purchase increases cost by 15%
    cost_growth_rate: 1.15

    # Visitors gained per manual click
    visitors_per_click: 1

    # Number of visitors needed to trigger a batch of sales
    # Every 100 visitors → buyers enter the funnel
    sale_trigger_threshold: 100

    # Conversion rate: percentage of visitors who become buyers
    # 0.10 = 10% of visitors convert to actual purchases
    conversion_rate: 0.10

    # Commission rate: percentage of sale value earned as revenue
    # 0.10 = 10% commission on each sale
    base_commission_rate: 0.10

    # Vertical upgrade cost scaling: cost = base × (upgradeGrowthRate ^ level)
    # At 1.25, each level increases upgrade cost by 25%
    vertical_upgrade_growth_rate: 1.25

    # Game tick interval in milliseconds
